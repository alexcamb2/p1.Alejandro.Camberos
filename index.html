		<h1>For Part B</h1> 
		<pre>Does the interface make doing common things easier?
			The interface makes the common things easier to accomplish because of how easy it is to distinguish some of the buttons.
			In the rarer cases, the interface is inconvient because of the location for the phone button on the elevator is hard to locate and the color for the emergency button is hard to distinguish between the other buttons
		</pre>
		<p>Think about how the user interacts with the elevator. What is the common sequence of actions?
			A common sequence of actions is to firt push the button to open the elevator.
			Next step is to push the button for the desired floor. The elevator should close, display what floor you are heading too, and play a tone to indicate its working.
			Finally, the elevator should play a tone upon arriving to the desired floor. The doors should open and then you can leave the elevator
		</p>
