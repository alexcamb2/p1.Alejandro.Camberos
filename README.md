Find the issues with the current design.
  Some of the issuse include:
    The emergency phone button being all the way at the bottom of the elevator
    Floor 1 is a star instead of the number one
    There is no clear indicator of the emergency button, hard to tell which one it is

Explain why it is good/bad.
  Some good things of the elevator include:
    Clear indication of the first and second floor
    The open and close door buttons are apart and can distinguish which one is which based on the arrows
    Elevator number is a contrasting color and can easily be distinguished
    
To get a B:
Common uses of elevators:
  Clicking a button to go to desired floor
  Carrying equipment
Rare Uses of elevators:
  Emergency phone use
  Emergency button use

Does the interface make doing those common things easier?
  The interface makes the common things easier to accomplish because of how easy it is to distinguis some of the buttons. The rarer cases the interface is inconvinient   because of the location for the phone button on the elevator and the color for the emergency button is hard to distinguish between the other ones.
  
Think about how the user interacts with the elevator. What is the common sequence of actions?
  A common sequence of actions is to first
    push the elevator button to open the door
    go inside the elevater and locate the floor you wish to go to
    push the button for that floor and the elevator door should close
    elevator goes to that floor indicated by a light to show the current floor
    elevator opens the door at the floor you requested

How does the elevator support the user to figure out how to make it work?
  The elevator has a few things to help the user figure out how it works
    Arrows pointing away or towards to indicate open/close door
    The spaces between the open and close door are far apart so you can clearly see which is which 
    The button for the phone has a picture of the phone on it
    The floors are indicated by either a star (first floor) or a 2 (second floor)

How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?
  The elevator provides feedback by
    Closing the elevator door when the floor button is pressed
    Numbers on top lighting up to show which floor you are on
    A sound is played when you click the elevator and another sound is played when the elevator arrives at the floor

What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?
  Some of the common mistakes include
    Accidentatly clicking on the emergency button
    Not being able to locate the phone button
    Mistaking the arrows that indicate the open and close button
