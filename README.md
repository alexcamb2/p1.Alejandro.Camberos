Find the issues with the current design.
  Some of the issuse include:
    The emergency phone button being all the way at the bottom of the elevator
    Floor 1 is a star instead of the number one
    There is no clear indicator of the emergency button, hard to tell which one it is

Explain why it is good/bad.
  Some good things of the elevator include:
    Clear indication of the first and second floor
    The open and close door buttons are apart and can distinguish which one is which based on the arrows
    Elevator number is a contrasting color and can easily be distinguished
    
To get a B:
Common uses of elevators:
  Clicking a button to go to desired floor
  Carrying equipment
Rare Uses of elevators:
  Emergency phone use
  Emergency button use

Does the interface make doing those common things easier?
  The interface makes the common things easier to accomplish because of how easy it is to         distinguis some of the buttons. The rarer cases the interface is inconvinient because of the l   location on the elevator for the phone button and the color for the emergency button
  
Think about how the user interacts with the elevator. What is the common sequence of actions?
